# Open Acess Network

I worked in a company that had a problem: we had a neutral network but no complete list of partner providers and their areas of operation. With this problem in mind, I developed the first version of this software for personal use and for my office colleagues. Even though, at first, the project didn't have any map API, just a static map with the areas of operation and a list of the providers, it was still a great help and saved us time, making our work in neutral network deployment much smoother.

## Project Evolution

Some of the main differences from the starting point, as mentioned earlier, were the use of an API, specifically the CEP/ZIP Code API, as well as the use of JavaScript to make the user experience smoother and more enjoyable. Another adjustment made was related to the dark mode, a page feature highly requested by users. Additionally, a major step was the implementation for larger and smaller devices, as before there was no responsiveness. Now, however, it's possible to use the tool on smartphones, tablets, and larger screens like televisions.

## Results 

Even in the early stages of the project, other departments benefited and were able to use the new tool efficiently. It combined the everyday need to know about neutral network partners and customer visibility with the ease of using the system itself. Now, it was no longer necessary to send multiple messages asking if provider X serviced a certain region, streamlining everyone's work.

## Learning 

In this project, I was able to explore and apply important concepts using JavaScript, especially dynamic API consumption by integrating the ZIP Code API to enhance the user experience.
I also focused on responsiveness, adapting the interface for different screen sizes — from mobile devices to TVs — which helped me improve my responsive design skills.
Additionally, I paid special attention to UI/UX, aiming for a more intuitive and seamless navigation. This included visual and functional adjustments based on user feedback, such as implementing dark mode and improving the overall usability of the application.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to integrate the Google Maps API to enhance address lookup functionality and provide more accurate location data.
I’m also considering adding a front-end framework to further enrich the user experience and streamline interface development.
